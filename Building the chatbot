Pre-trained models on Hugging Face:

These models are trained on general data and aren't typically niche-specific.
They provide a good starting point but usually require fine-tuning for niche applications.
They don't inherently contain the specific data you need for your niche.

Datasets like Docmatix:

Docmatix is a large, general-purpose dataset for document question-answering.
It's useful for training models on document understanding but may not contain niche-specific information.
Similar datasets on Hugging Face can be valuable for general capabilities but typically aren't niche-focused.

Strategies for niche-specific data:
a. Web Scraping:

  Identify authoritative websites in your niche.
  Use web scraping tools to collect relevant information (puppeteer comes to mind).

b. API Access:

  Some industries have APIs providing access to specialized data.

c. Partnerships:

  Collaborate with industry organizations or companies for access to their data.

d. Public Datasets:

  Look for government or academic datasets in your niche.

e. Manual Curation:

  Have domain experts compile Q&A pairs or important information.

f. User-Generated Content:

  Forums, social media, or Q&A sites in your niche can be valuable data sources.

g. Existing Documentation:

  Industry whitepapers, manuals, or guides can be rich sources of information.


Our current strategy: 
Combining Approaches:

  Start with a pre-trained model for general language understanding.
  Use datasets like Docmatix for general document-handling capabilities.
  Fine-tune with your niche-specific data gathered through the methods listed above.

Example of the strategy:

*Step 1: Define the Chatbot's Purpose

Purpose: Assist patients with appointment scheduling, answer basic medical questions, and provide clinic information.

*Step 2: Select Pre-trained Models

For general language understanding:

Model: BERT model (Transformers)
Reason: Good at understanding context in natural language.


However for medical knowledge:

Model: BioBERT or ClinicalBERT
Reason: Specifically trained on biomedical and clinical text.


*Step 3: Incorporating Docmatix

Use Docmatix to enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and process document-based queries.
Relevant for: Understanding medical forms, processing patient information sheets.

*Step 4: Gather Niche-Specific Data

Clinic-specific information:

  Source: Clinic's website, brochures, and internal documents.
  Content: Services offered, doctor profiles, operating hours, policies.


Medical FAQ:

  Source: Compile common patient questions and answers from clinic staff.
  Content: Basic health advice, preparation for common procedures.


Appointment scheduling information:

  Source: Clinic's scheduling system and policies.
  Content: Available time slots, required information for booking.


Public health information:

  Source: Reputable medical websites, CDC, WHO.
  Content: General health tips, seasonal health advice.



*Step 5: Data Processing and Integration

Pre-process clinic-specific data:

  Clean and format the gathered information.
  Create Q&A pairs from the clinic's information.


Fine-tune the pre-trained models:

  Use the processed clinic data to fine-tune BERT/BioBERT.
  This adapts the model to the specific language and context of your clinic.


Integrate Docmatix:

  Use Docmatix to train the model on understanding medical documents.
  Focus on relevant document types like medical forms and information sheets.



*Step 6: Develop RAG System

Create a vector database:

  Index all processed clinic data, FAQs, and relevant parts of Docmatix.
  Use this for efficient retrieval of relevant information.


Implement retrieval mechanism:

When a query comes in, retrieve relevant information from the vector database.


Response generation:

Use the fine-tuned BERT/BioBERT model to generate responses based on retrieved information.



*Step 7: Implement Specialized Functions

Appointment scheduling:

Integrate with the clinic's scheduling system API.
Implement logic for checking available slots and booking appointments.


Medical question filtering:

Implement a system to identify questions requiring professional medical advice.
For these, provide a response directing the user to consult a healthcare professional.



*Step 8: Testing and Iteration

Internal testing:

Have clinic staff interact with the chatbot to identify gaps or inaccuracies.


Limited patient testing:

Roll out to a small group of patients for feedback.


Continuous improvement:

Regularly update the chatbot with new information and based on user interactions.
